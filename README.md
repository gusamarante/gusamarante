More about me on [my website][mysite]

Currently working in the Asset Allocation team at BWGI, and pursuing a PhD in Economics at Insper. I hold a master’s degree in economics from PUC-Rio and a bachelor’s from Insper, and more than a decade of experience working with financial markets. 

My main interests are empirical finance and systematic strategies. I also enjoy developing Python libraries to support research in finance and macroeconomics.
