My name is Gustavo Curi Amarante, I am an economist from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I work in the asset allocation team at BWGI and as finance lecturer at Insper.

Professionally, I am interested in asset allocation and systematic strategies. Academically, I also enjoy some structural macroeconomics and macro-finance from time to time.
