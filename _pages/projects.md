This repository was born as a quantitative finance project during my studies 
for the CQF, but it ended up as  an all-around finance project. You can find

# bayesfm
Python package to run [Bayesian Fama-MacBeth Regressions from Bryzgalova, Huang & Julliard (2024)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4989615).
As presented by the authors, this methodology provides reliable risk premia 
estimates for both tradable and nontradable factors, detects those weakly 
identified, delivers valid credible intervals for all objects of interest, and 
is intuitive, fast and simple to implement.

# DSGEpy
This is a Python library to specify, calibrate, solve, simulate, estimate and 
analyze linearized DSGE models. The specification interface is inpired by 
dynare, which allows for symbolic declarations of parameters, variables and 
equations. This library is an effort to bring the DSGE toolset into the 
open-source world in a full python implementation.
