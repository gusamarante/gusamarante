# Python Projects
## pyAA
This repository was born as a quantitative finance project during my studies for the CQF, but it ended up as 
an all-around finance project.

## DSGEpy
This is a Python library to specify, calibrate, solve, simulate, estimate and analyze linearized DSGE models.
The specification interface is inpired by dynare, which allows for symbolic declarations of parameters,
variables and equations. This library is an effort to bring the DSGE toolset into the open-source world in a
full python implementation.

You can find more details about on [dsgepy.com](http://dsgepy.com)
